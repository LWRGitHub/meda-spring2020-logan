          <h3>Art<br><small>Artist as a Hobby</small></h3>
          <p>Hello, my name is Logan & I am an artist. I sell art on Redbuble and some times in person. I love making art as it is a wonderful way of passing the time. With a blank canvas and some paints limits don't excist to what you can make. Althou I don't make any from art it is a wonderful hobby.</p>

          <p>I engoy doing this hobby because I belive it helps to free my mind. The prosses of art is more fun when I do abstract art as I don't have to focus so much on making sure it is perfect. But I often "not always" love the end resalt more when I make detaled art as if I painted an image. I fined that I not only love to make art but I love to watch others make art. I found several youtube videos where people make art & I got to thinking maybe I should do that also. Over all art is a very wonderful way of atempting to free my mind.</p>
